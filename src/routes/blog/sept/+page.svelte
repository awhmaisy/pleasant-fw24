<p>
    do so enjoy this september! i am so happy to welcome in a new month - one that brings much change in my corporeal life. i'm very excited to browse furnitures for a new space of mine, browse new spaces as a whole, and usher in the air of newness. 
</p>
<p>
    akin to my previous practices of "style report" on patreon, i'll be sharing a few of my recent favorites and point your way to a few new stars that i've been wishing on. 
</p>
<p>
    much love and adoration your way; i hope that this collection of moments to come find you in a place that is open and welcoming, and i do intend for you and your joy to be protected by all that is good in this life.
</p>

    i've been watching

        anon, 2018
    </li>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        very gorgeous. i find that the more recent i watch, the more coherent; and somehow i do not enjoy that. i did, however, enjoy the graphics francisco garc√≠a nava contributed to.
    </p>
</ul>

<h2>
    i've been longing
</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 0px;">
    longing for items is a favorite pastime; i have only loved this lately. of course, i fell into the recognizable plight of feeling like i need in order to be; but the feeling of restraint makes me content with my consumption habits.
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="color: #ea9ae5">

    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
        in terms of style, there reveals a great divide between what i like to wear myself and what i enjoy looking at. i've always been a very demeulemeester-yamamoto-owens adjacent viewer, but i prefer a very simple and clean cut daily look.  
    </p>
    <li style="color: #ea9ae5">

    </li>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 20px;">
        if i were to cry for anyone when i sleep, i would cry for this bag! my bestie bae has a suede version and i just NEED a ton of pockets.. that's my flow. my ultimate aside from a balenciaga cagole or city.

        very comfy for sleeping! i'm really, really looking forward to a nice and cozy fall.

        because who wouldn't want an assault rifle chillin' on their thigh during a 200 person business lecture? hahhahahahha

        i am a sucker for any garment that implies any association with intelligence, secret operations, and information. so yeah. i want this f#cking shirt.

    my daily-drive pretty much consists of odd, probably gpu-adjacent and crypto conference shirts, or overflowing rick owens / dion lee pants with a teeny top. quite polar. 
</p>
<p>
    i bridge this gap well at university (unfortunately and fortunately, you will not catch me in plaid pajama pants at lecture. i will likely be buttoned up top, with a pleated mini-skirt and heels to match) but i would like to introduce some new characters to my wardrobe.

    possibly more updates as time passes but mucho amor for now! see yaaa
