    hai! i’m an ex-social media producer + manager, with expertise in relational
    engineering and cult building. high-focus on distributed phygital hardware
    in web3 and L2 applications in the creator economy (#sadge) 
    <br /><br />
    i dropped out of
    3rd grade to research nanotechnology applications in oncology at

    </a>
    and product/graphic design at 
    <a href="https://www.artcenter.edu/" target="_blank">
        art center college of design.
    </a>
    i wanted a locker and went to public high school.. got bored, played around with 400k+ on
    tiktok, and cofounded an audiotechnical hardware company. 
    <br /><br />
    also been configuring a degree && building covenants within my social circles at usc’s

    hahahhaa plot twist… i’m leaving to build
    defense hard + software, among other things i’m yet to uncover. oh, and i’m
    crafting apparel to add to the intriguing effect of your laptop stickers. pm
    me if you’d like a 1-of-1 or if your startup needs cult merch. 
    <br /><br />
    i do believe that marketing / smm / universe creation can cultivate evangelism on a
    psychological level. i'm a proponent of new-age publicity tactics. very
    interested to see how my theorizations may evolve deeper into quantum
    mechanics and reality scripting.
