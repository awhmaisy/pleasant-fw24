    hi! i’m an ex-social media producer + manager, with expertise in relational
    engineering and cult building. high-focus on distributed phygital hardware
    in web3 and L2 applications in the creator economy (#sadge)
    <br /><br />
    i dropped out of 3rd grade to research nanotech applications in oncology at
    <a href="https://tdg.ucla.edu/" target="_blank"> ucla BSC </a>
    and the fun of product/graphic design at
    <a href="https://www.artcenter.edu/" target="_blank"> ACCD. </a>
    i wanted a locker and went to public high school.. got bored, sniped ogu's, played
    around with 400k+ on tiktok and an audiotechnical hardware company.
    <br /><br />
